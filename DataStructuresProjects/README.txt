Executable is in "Debug" folder of every project.
Each project comes with a document with extensive documentation of each program, it's purpose, the purpose fo each function, and each function's Big O complexity.

Project 1: Conway's Game of Life
- Simulation of John Conway’s famous “Game of Life” simulation utilizing dynamic memory allocation and turn-based processing.

Project 2: String Adder
- Adds two numbers that are received as strings. Intended to bypass variable type restrictions to allow users to enter a number of any size. Supports addition with negative numbers.

Project 3: Circular Queue Structures
- Three different implementations of a queue structure. 1) Uses a dynamic array which avoids constant reshuffling of numbers by keeping track of the start and end of the user defined queue maintaining a “circular” structure. 2) Uses a normal linked list implementation as well. 3) Uses a circular linked list where the last node connects to the first node.

Project 4: Binary Search Trees
- Implementation of a binary search tree structure that is able to print in preorder, inorder, and postorder.
