To run the build, please unzip the "ConstellationGame" folder and run the executable in the folder.
The executable must be in the same folder as every other item in that folder to work properly, so please do not remove anything from the resulting folder.

Right now the game is unfinished and may contain bugs/unfinished features.

Some things to note:

- The button on the title screen clears progres when clicked.
- Levels are out of order, so difficulty may jump in places.
- Score thresholds are the same for each level and will be edited in the final release based on that individual level.
	(Some thresholds I imagine are impossible to achieve in some levels for now).

Source code available upon request.

Made in GameMaker Studio 2.
